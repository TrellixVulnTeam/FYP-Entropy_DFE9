This github page hosts the software created by Ong Li-Jun Benjamin for the purpose of the Final Year Project "The Correlation of Entropy with Annotator Agreement in Corpus Linguistics".

The /env directory contains two Jupyter notebooks, six Microsoft Excel files and a Processed folder. The other folders are background scripts and utility modules.
FYP_entropy.ipynb is the program used to process raw corpora data.
2Dbs.ipynb is the program used to compare two processed databases to determine their annotator agreement rates.
The Processed folder contains the resulting pickles from running the raw databases through the FYP_entropy.ipynb notebook.
The six Excel files contain the collated data from running the Processed folder pickles through the 2Dbs.ipynb notebook, as well as some formulae for entropy and agreement calculations.
The raw corpora are not uploaded due to their size.
